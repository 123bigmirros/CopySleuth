# TODO

- Pin a specific PaddleOCR commit or tag in `scripts/versions.env` (currently unset).
- Confirm the intended DINOv3 model variant (default is `facebook/dinov3-vitb16-pretrain-lvd1689m`).
- Confirm the SAM3 checkpoint filename and gating requirements; ensure `sam3/sam3_checkpoints/sam3.pt` is the intended artifact.
- Document required Hugging Face access tokens for gated Meta models (SAM3/DINOv3) in README.
